# Towards Adaptive Subspace Detection in Heterogeneous Environment

This GitHub repository was made to present the results of an adaptive matched filter designed for a heterogeneous environment where the test data noise covariance may differ from the secondary set covariance in structure. In particular we use the model $\textbf{y}={\textbf{H}{\theta}}+{\textbf{B}\{\phi}}+\boldsymbol\xi$, where the hypothesis testing problem is ${\mathcal{H}_0}=
\textbf{y}=\textbf{B}{\phi}+{\xi} \sim \mathcal{C}\mathcal{N}(\textbf{B}{\phi},\sigma^2\textbf{R})\\
\textbf{y}_k=\textbf{n}_k \sim \mathcal{C}\mathcal{N}(\textbf{0},\sigma^2_k\textbf{R}_s), k=1,\cdots,K$
